# Repository for 8th Light Application

Hello! These are the solved problems for my 8th Light Application.

They are located in `first` and `second`, and both contain an README with a description on the problem.
In there, you'll find specific instructions on how to run and test the problems.

## Okay, I got it, but what's the first and second folders? Give me a preview of the problems.

How rude of me.
In the `first` folder, you will find a solution to read a random line from a file. That's about it.
In the `second` folder, you will find a basic spelling checker, with input data and basic testing.

## Right, and what you've used?

I'm pretty confortable with NodeJS and JavaScript, so I used that.

No more talking, let's see some code. The instructions are on the folders. Have fun!
