# Spelling checker
 
This problem was pretty fun. It's a basic spelling checker. You can find more information on the problem here: http://www.puzzlenode.com/puzzles/3-spelling-suggestions.

## So, show me what you've done.

Fair enough. Here's a quick guide:

*  `cd` inside this folder
* `npm install` everything
* You can test this if you want. I used mocha, so you need to have that installed. If you do, just run `mocha` and check everything is ok.
* `main.js` contains the code to run the problem as described in the link above. It follows the format specified. The code to check the spelling is in `suggestion.js`.
* Mess up with the INPUT I've provided, with `cat INPUT.txt | node main`, if you like.
* That's about it.
